#Data Types

#String

#This prints the first letter of Hello. This is known as Subscript.
print("Hello"[0])
print("Hello"[len("Hello")-1])

#You can also print the last character by entering a negative number in the indice
print("Hello"[-1])

#This is still a string
print("123")

#Contatinating, by using the + symbol
print("Hello " + "World!")

#Integer, this is basically a whole number
print(123 + 345)

#To add commas use underscores
print(123_456_789)

#Float, this basically a number with a decimal
print(4.14159)

#Boolean, only two possible values of True or False
True
False

#Convert this into a way that the len() function works
print(len('12345'))

#The code below will give an error becuase print function cannot concatanate strings
#and ints together.
num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))
#This converts an int to a string
new_num_char = str(num_char)
#This shows us the type of data type the variable is
print(type(new_num_char))
print("Your name has " + new_num_char + " Characters.")
#This converts it to a string
new_num_char = str(num_char)
#This converts it to diffrent data type and to show the data types 
a = 123
print(type(a))
a = str(123)
print(type(a))
a = float(123)
print(type(a))
print(type(True))

#These are some data type cast converter functions
int()
float()
str()
bool()

#Casting to int just chops off the decimal value
print(8/3)

#New challange
print("Number of letters in your name: " + str(len(input("Enter your last name: "))))
