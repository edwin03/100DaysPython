#This prints the first letter of Hello. This is known as Subscript.
print("Hello"[0])
print("Hello"[len("Hello")-1])

#This is still a string
print("123")

#Contatinating, by using the + symbol
print("Hello " + "World!")

#Integer, this is basically a whole number
print(123 + 345)

#To add commas use underscores
print(123_456_789)

#Float, this basically a number with a decimal
print(4.14159)

#Boolean, only two possible values of True or False
True
False

#The code below will give an error becuase print function cannot concatanate strings
#and ints together.

#This converts it to a string
